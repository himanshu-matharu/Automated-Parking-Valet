# Automated Parking Valet system implementation using MATLAB

This code implements the following tasks which are a subset of tasks involved in an automated parking valet system:
- Initial pose estimation using **MonteCarlo Localization**
- Path Planning from initial pose to goal pose using **A\* Hybrid Path Planner**

## Implementation

The project_code.m contains the code for the project. The ExampleHelperAMCLVisualization.m contains the visualization function for the MonteCarlo algorithm and is taken from the MATLAB [example](https://in.mathworks.com/help/nav/ug/localize-turtlebot-using-monte-carlo-localization.html).
